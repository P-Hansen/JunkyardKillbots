-----Feedback
I am still very new to GameMaker Studio 2 and programming. If you have any tips or feedback 
on this project, please leave a comment on https://randatabase.itch.io/
There might be better ways to make this project and I'd love to hear about them. 

-----Credits
Full project (including the pixel art)â€‹ has been made by me 'RanDB '.
Although crediting me is appreciated, it is not required. However, 
please do not claim any of my pixel art as your own.

Thank you for downloading my project.
Have fun!
